# 🔎 Prediction Process

When a user uploads an image:

1. Image is resized to **224 × 224**
2. Converted into a **NumPy array**
3. Passed through the **trained CNN**
4. Model outputs **class probabilities**
5. System returns **top 3 pest predictions**

### Example Output

```
Armyworm — 0.87
Aphids — 0.09
Beetle — 0.04
```
